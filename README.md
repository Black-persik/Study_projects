# Study projects
📌 **This repository contains my learning projects and problem solutions in various programming languages. Each folder corresponds to a different language, which makes it convenient to navigate through the materials. Here you will find algorithm implementations, study assignments, and small projects created during the learning process.**

## 🗂 Repository structure  
- [Java](/Java/) – Java solutions ☕
- [C++](/C++/) – C++ solutions ➕➕  
- [C](/C/) – C solutions ©️  
- [Python](/Python/) – Python solutions 🐍
- [Algorithms](/Algorithms/) - Algorithmic solutions 🅰️

## 📝 How to use it 
1. Navigate to the desired language folder. 
2. Find the task by name (for example, `twoSum.java`). 
3. Open the file and see the solution.
4. Initial tasks are available for each solution in every `README.md` file.
